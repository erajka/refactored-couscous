# X-Team 67 Style Guide

We want our code to be very readable and consistent

## Naming conventions

 using camel case for variables, classes and uppercase for final variables, using variable names that show what they are representing instead of just a random letter. 

### Examples
* interfaces
* classes
* exception types
* fields
* methods
* parameters
* local variables
* instance constants
* class constants

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

We use javadoc for all public and private methods and constructors.
We will use in-line comments on fields by putting "// " below the line.
Opening bracket will be with the header(declaration) and the closing bracket will be on its own line for loops/if statements/ switch..


### Examples

* classes
* fields
* constructors
* methods
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
