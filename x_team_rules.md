# X-Team 67 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
People will volunteer on certain tasks and the rest we will decide based on who is left. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We have a group message and we will communicate when we have finished (or forgotten) to do our parts.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Tell the group message and ask for help from someone who better understands.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Keep close contact and create a very open environment so people feel comfortable asking for help. We want to be finsihed with the project before the deadline approaches.
